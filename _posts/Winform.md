C# is a programming language that I do not like, it takes up a lot of time, reosurces and energy to run. This project is written in C#. Together with my team we develop a winform application and connect it to RPI3 using grove.

## Week 1-4 

I have completed all my school practical and created a kanban board for my team. I then made tutorial videos for my team to teach them how to use certain features of visual studio 2015. My progress has been going a bit slow but we did submit the project proposal. Excited to see what comes next!
