## Week1 
One day a message appeared in whatsapp "Also bro, I rlly think we should start a fintech biz/startup tgt". What an intresting opportunity. Edus is a friend I met in NYP, EC club and he frequently post investment videos on youtube. We started brainstorming for ideas.

## Week2
We wanted to do something with automation, ai and collaboration, maybe something like an automation tool. I build a automation tool and showed him. Together we discussed if this is a viable product. After trying to find value, we decided to scratch this idea. However we decided to call our project Bihance, shorted for business enhanced

## Week3
Maybe a HR tool would be of some use. Edus shared with me that in a previous event job, they had an unconvient way to take attendance and he felt something can be done for it. During the sememster break, we found a logo that we liked and stuck to it. We started to investgate the feasability of it.

## Week4
We crafted a plan to progress forward and we started cold calling to get feedback on our idea. I created a prototype MVP. We research more on what it takes to create a startup. Should we get a domain name? Maybe register for ACRA?
